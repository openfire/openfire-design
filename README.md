This repository contains files to aid in the development of the openfire design and style.

The pages that have been exported for design live in /pages. Common third-party files for all pages live in /third\_party. Actual openfire source coffee, sass, and image files all live in /source.

The /tools directory is used when creating new project files, and contains a script that renames all common and third party file locations.

So, to work on a design, feel free to just edit the files for the page, such as the /pages/project/project\_files/\* files, and commit the change to the repo.
